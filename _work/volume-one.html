			<h2>It’s Complicated</h2>
			<p>A Guide to Making Things is the first (and currently only) in the series. We worked with the brilliant Hey, who interpreted our eight ideas to create illustrations, which we produced as a limited run of 100 sets of postcards, and a companion website with animated versions. The ideas are the guiding principals we wrote when we first started Fieldwork.</p>
