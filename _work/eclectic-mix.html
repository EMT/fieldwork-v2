			Rebecca Scott, Jewellery designer and creator of the Eclectic Mix brand, approached us to give her existing brand identity a refresh to coincide with the release of her new collection, <em>For Vera</em>. She also wanted an accessible platform for consumers to purchase the collections - rather than relying solely on independent distributors. Creating a website built on the Shopify E-commerce platform allowed for her growing brand to expand and adapt.

			<h2>It’s Complicated</h2>

			<p>Home energy assessment is complicated. The tools used to model energy use have several hundred data points, most of which are measured and filled in manually. If you’re at the point where you’re ready to invest in work to make your home more efficient, it makes sense to work with an architect to get the modelling right and make sure you invest in the most cost-effective measures for your specific situation. But how do you reach this point?</p>

			<p>This project aims to provide an entry point for curious homeowners. It’s an antidote to the overwhelming level of detail that can quickly put people off when they start researching home energy efficiency, and it’s a simple, inviting web application that can be easily passed along and shared without a lengthy explanation.</p>
