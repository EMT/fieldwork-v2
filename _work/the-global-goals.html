			<h2>International Collaboration</h2>

			<p>The campaign involved a global pop-up radio station, the world’s first international cinema ad, and a host of celebrity supporters. We worked directly with Richard Curtis’ Project Everyone team, the Gates Foundation, ONE, and Global Citizen to support the UN in spreading the word about the goals.</p>

			<h2>Global Reach in 21 Languages</h2>

			<p>Hosting all campaign activity, the Global Goals website had to adapt rapidly to manage planned milestones as well as react quickly to unexpected events. It also had to accommodate 21 different languages and handle large spikes in visitor numbers.</p>
