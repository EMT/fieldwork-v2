				<p>Designing and developing a new website for TILT gave us the opportunity to explore ways to tell the stories of their innovative process. The challenge here was in creating a content managed site that would use the lovely imagery they’ve collected throughout their work to showcase the story of each project and product.</p>
				<p>We devised a grid system with strict image dimensions to provide a consistent sense of order at varying screen sizes and across various devices. This grid combined with a minimal design allows TILT’s wealth of content to do the talking, and their work to shine.</p>
