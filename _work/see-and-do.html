		<p>On the whole, homes are pretty inefficient when it comes to making the most of the energy they consume. Energy efficiency has come a long way in recent years, though, and most houses can benefit from improvement measures, the cost of which can be offset by energy savings over time. Using less energy is a big win for everyone.</p>

			<h2>It’s Complicated</h2>

			<p>Home energy assessment is complicated. The tools used to model energy use have several hundred data points, most of which are measured and filled in manually. If you’re at the point where you’re ready to invest in work to make your home more efficient, it makes sense to work with an architect to get the modelling right and make sure you invest in the most cost-effective measures for your specific situation. But how do you reach this point?</p>

			<p>This project aims to provide an entry point for curious homeowners. It’s an antidote to the overwhelming level of detail that can quickly put people off when they start researching home energy efficiency, and it’s a simple, inviting web application that can be easily passed along and shared without a lengthy explanation.</p>

			<h2>How Big is Your House?</h2>

			<p>To reduce the data entry required to perform the calculations and produce results, we partnered with Ordnance Survey as a data source for information. Using OS data, we’re able to start with a postcode and lookup data like square footage, ceiling heights and building outline, all of which can be used to make calculations more accurate. This moves a lot of the complexity into the background, out of the way of the user.</p>

			<p>Using the same underlying calculator as Carbon Co-op’s professional tool gives us the benefit of being able to export a user’s data as a starting point for a professional assessment, should they choose to get in touch and want to take the next step.</p>
