		<p>It’s not always easy to strike a good work/life balance. Towards the end of a busy 2015 we realised we’d been missing out on lots of local events — Manchester has plenty of meetups, workshops, exhibitions and gigs, and we weren’t paying attention.</p>

			<h2>A Simple Problem</h2>

			<p>It’s a simple problem, which we can break into three parts. We need to be reminded to search out local events, we need a place to list them, and we need to plan to attend them. Initially, we thought about using an internal online chat to list local goings on. This would have worked well enough as a listing for the Fieldwork team, but it probably wouldn’t have motivated us to regularly research and find interesting events.</p>
			
			<p>See+Do is a simple list of upcoming events. It’s a public website, so we’re motivated to keep the content fresh, which forces us to pro-actively find interesting things that are happening around town. It doesn’t help us plan to attend events, but who knows, a future iteration might.</p>

			<h2>Realising Little Ideas</h2>

			<p>We’re making a concerted effort to quickly and iteratively realise little ideas like this one. We launched this quickly, with just a few days total design and development time, so it’s a little rough around the edges, but it’s a work in progress.</p>
