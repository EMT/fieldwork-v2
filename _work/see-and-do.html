		<p>It’s not always easy to strike a good work/life balance. Towards the end of a busy 2015 we realised we’d been missing out on lots of local events — Manchester has plenty of meetups, workshops, exhibitions and gigs, and we weren’t paying attention.</p>

			<h2>A Simple Problem</h2>

			<p>There are three problems to solve here: we need to be nudged to find local events, we need a place to list them, and we need to make time and plan to attend them. Initially, we thought about using an internal online chat to list local goings on. This would have worked fine as a listing for the Fieldwork team, but it probably wouldn’t motivate us to regularly research and find interesting events.</p>

			<p>See+Do is a simple list of upcoming events. Because it’s public, we’re motivated to keep the content fresh, so it forces us to pro-actively find interesting things that are happening around town. This often becomes a conversation in the studio, which prompts us to get out more.</p>
