			<p>Sustrans help organisations like local authorities and universities run challenge events that encourage people to change their travel habits and move around in more active and sustainable ways. As weâ€™d already worked on the web platform for these events, they asked us to help them build a quick, simple and mobile-friendly way for participants to get involved and log journeys.</p>
			<p>Since so many people carry GPS enabled devices around in their pockets every day, we devised a very simple mobile app, for iOS and Android devices, that allows participants to track and log their journeys in just a few taps.</p>
