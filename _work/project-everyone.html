			<h2>Putting Everyone First</h2>

			<p>Project Everyone aims to, “not simply share the SDGs but to connect all of humanity in one generation defining moment in which we all understand our fates are intertwined, interconnected, interdependent.”</p>
			<p>Briefs don’t come much more inspiring than this, and the project’s identity has to be equally ambitious and inspiring. It must be humble not imposing, interactive not prescribed, and it should put Everyone first. It should revolve around people, contribution, and connection. It should help people to communicate Project Everyone within their own communities and to their own audiences, in their own voices. It should inspire people to take an active role in Project Everyone and to take responsibility for helping to reach seven billion people.</p>

			<h2>Everyone’s Everyone</h2>

			<p>The ‘Everyone’ in the Project Everyone logo can be recreated by anyone, anywhere, whether it’s written with pen on paper, drawn in the sand, or formed with stones on the ground. ‘Project’ is used as an anchor point, a flexible way to connect many “Everyone’s” and provide consistency for communicating and sharing the project. This can start small, with a few handwritten versions by key ambassadors, and grow into an expanding library of contributions.</p>
