				<p>For TILT’s new website, we wanted to explore ways to tell the stories of their innovative process. The challenge here was in creating a content managed site that would use the huge quantity of high-quality imagery they’ve collected throughout their work to showcase the story of each project and product.</p>
				<p>We devised a grid system with strict image dimensions to provide a consistent sense of order at varying screen sizes and across various devices. Combining this with a minimal design allows TILT’s work to shine and their wealth of content to do the talking.</p>
