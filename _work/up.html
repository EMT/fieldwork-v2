				<h2>The Challenge</h2>
				<p>Up helps employers confidently train and support young employees in their professional development. Having done some discovery and UX work on the project already, the client brought us in to help define key workflows, wireframe, and design and build the user interfaces.</p>
				<p>The application serves two main audiences: young employees who interact with Up to regularly add goals and outcomes; and employers or line managers who feed back on employees’ progress. Mobile access was an important consideration, as the client expected young employes to access the application on the move (on the journey into work, for example). With this in mind, we designed and developed the user interfaces mo- bile-first, and worked those designs up into desktop versions later.</p>
				<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p>Once testing started with real users, we quickly discovered how important the desktop views are for Up. Em- ployers and line managers usually access the application at their desks or on laptops, and like to have a quick overview of key metrics and activity. We iterated on the views for larger screen to make the most of the extra space.</p>
				<p>Young employees are now using Up to set short-term (weekly) and long-term goals, feeding back on and quan- tifying specific aspects of their own progress. The application encourages consistent two-way communica- tion, and managers are prompted to review and feed back at regular intervals. Employers have useful metrics and overviews to help them manage professional development and have productive conversations with their employees.</p>
