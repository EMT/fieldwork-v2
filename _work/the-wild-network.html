		<p>Kids are becoming disconnected from nature. Cities have less green space, parents have less time, and billions are spent on persuading children to play games on screens and indoors. The Wild Network are building a movement to remind us how much fun it is to play outside.</p>

			<h2>Growing, Strengthening and Mobilising a Community</h2>

			<p>One of the most consistently successful ways to tackle behaviour change, is to start with the people who donâ€™t need any persuasion. Building a core of enthusiastic participants and advocates increases resources, provides social evidence when engaging new people, and gives your cause more public visibility.</p>
			<p>The Wild Network website engages the passionate community around the cause, bringing them together and turning them into participants through events and suggested ways to get outside. It also mobilises the community with campaigns, content around key issues, and ways for the community to lobby for change. This focus has helped grow the membership from 10,000 to 25,000 in just a few months.</p>

			<h2>A Brand for Nature</h2>

			<p>The brand identity has to strike a balance between playful and serious. This is all about reconnecting children with nature, and that connection has to be about fun: playing outside, getting muddy, climbing trees, building dens, and spying insects. Disconnection from nature is a serious issue, though, and The Wild Network brand also has to be ready to have high-level conversations on serious topics like obesity and depression.</p>
